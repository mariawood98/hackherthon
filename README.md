# Hack-her-thongs: Flare App

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased incidence of domestic violence and potential for women to be trapped in uncomfortable/frightening/abusive situations. We have created an app which allows for inconspicuous contacting of friends, family or the police and asking for help in a way that is hidden from the aggressor. This is done by having the user interface masked as a calming meditation/photos app, and trigger words being typical everyday words used in conversation to not arouse suspicion. 

The app allows for the user to set an 'activation' word, 'trigger' words, and the numbers/contacts they would like to communicate with in Settings. When the image button is pressed, the app will start listening. If the activation word, such as 'weather' is heard, the app will wake up and listen further. If a specified trigger word is heard, such as 'sun', a message is sent via Whatsapp to an assigned contact for that trigger word, including the coordinates of the user. 

We have also built an alternative front-end HTML website design for the app.
